    "## k-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "* Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.\n",
    "* The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation. When a specific value for k is chosen, it may be used in place of k in the reference to the model, such as k=10 becoming 10-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "* Cross-validation is primarily used in applied machine learning to estimate the skill of a machine learning model on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model\n",
    "* It is a popular method because it is simple to understand and because it generally results in a less biased or less optimistic estimate of the model skill than other methods, such as a simple train/test split."

    "* k=n: The value for k is fixed to n, where n is the size of the dataset to give each test sample an opportunity to be used in the hold out dataset. This approach is called leave-one-out cross-validation"

    "* LOOCV: Taken to another extreme, k may be set to the total number of observations in the dataset such that each observation is given a chance to be the held out of the dataset. This is called leave-one-out cross-validation, or LOOCV for short.\n",
    "* Stratified: The splitting of data into folds may be governed by criteria such as ensuring that each fold has the same proportion of observations with a given categorical value, such as the class outcome value. This is called stratified cross-validation.\n",
    "* Repeated: This is where the k-fold cross-validation procedure is repeated n times, where importantly, the data sample is shuffled prior to each repetition, which results in a different split of the sample.\n",
    "* Nested: This is where k-fold cross-validation is performed within each fold of cross-validation, often to perform hyperparameter tuning during model evaluation. This is called nested cross-validation or double cross-validation"
